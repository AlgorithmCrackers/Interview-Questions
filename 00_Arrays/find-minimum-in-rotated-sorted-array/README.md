# Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`).

Find the minimum element.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

## Example 1:

```
Input: [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
```

## Complexity Analysis:

- **Time complexity** : `O(log n)`. Same as binary search

- **Space complexity** : `O(1)`. only 3 variables have been used.
