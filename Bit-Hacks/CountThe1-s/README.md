##How Does it Work

###Method 1:
Step 1:
```
1 is subtracted from the number
```

Step 2:
```
perform x AND x-1 to remove the last 1.  See the below diagram
count variable takes count of the number of 1 in the variable
```
____￼________________
|x| 0010110111010000|
|x-1| 0010110111001111|
|x & (x-1)|0010110111000000|
____________________________

Step 3:
```
output the count 
```
#### Performance
Proportinal to the number of bits in the word. Takes O(n) time in worst case if all the bits are one.

### Method 2:
#### Strategy:      
Parallel divide- and-conquer

####Performance:
Takes O(lg n) times where n is the word Length.
