# Problem:
  ```
given n, find the number of different ways to write
n as the sum of 1, 3, 4
```
## Example: 
```
for n = 5, the answer is 6
5 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
= 1 + 1 + 3
= 1 + 3 + 1
= 3 + 1 + 1
= 1 + 4
= 4 + 1
```

## Result:
for n = 40, Dynamic solution took `0.06s` while recursive solution took `1.35s`
